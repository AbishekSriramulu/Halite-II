# Halite II
Halite is an open source artificial intelligence programming challenge, created by Two Sigma, where players build bots using the coding language of their choice to battle on a two-dimensional virtual board.

The source code shared is my code for the halite II challenge. I have used Keras to write the neural network on tensorflow.
